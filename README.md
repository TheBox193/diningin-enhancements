# diningin-tweaks
Fix up Diningin with a few tweaks. 

• Highlight items that less than $11 (or set your own)
• Updates highlighting when item added to cart
• Add hearts next to most loved items
• Checkout button goes directly to checkout, skipping drinks.
• Adds gluten-free indicator next to restaurants with gf options
• Cleans up the diningin site, removing unneeded elements for a cleaner ui
• Removes the ugly low-res salad in the background ;)
